# Factor Falls

This game is a personal project intended to demonstrate my documentation skills, my problem solving skills, and my ability to create a working HTML+JS game over a month-long period. Details on the development may be found in the ``devlog`` folder. More details will be added as the project gains functionality.

New builds will be produced every day. You may see the current build at:
