# Factor Falls

You are an apprentice to the great mathemagician Mobius. He needs rare prime numbers for his powerful numeric spells. Unfortunately, only common digits can be found easily above ground.

Mobius has given you a special device, the decacus, that can break any 3-digit number into prime factors. Collect the numbers as they fall down the Digit River to create factors. Bigger factors means more points, but only if you collect a set of three. Be careful! It's game over if you miss too many digits or run out of prime space!

This game is a personal project intended to demonstrate my documentation skills, my problem solving skills, and my ability to create a working HTML+JS game over a month-long period. Details on the development may be found [here](https://github.com/tsay3/FactorFalls/blob/master/devlog/index.md). More details will be added as the project gains functionality.

New builds will be produced every day. You may see the current build at:
