# Day 1: Drawing on the Canvas

## State of the Game

It is just a blank web page with empty JS scripts attached.

## Today's Goal

Draw the areas for the game on the canvas, and a "cartridge" to collect falling tiles.

## Background

Putting graphics on screen is one of the most fundamental parts of the application -- and it's already one of those parts that I'm less than familiar with. Most of my previous experiences with JS interaction have been with HTML forms and built-in UI. But let's see if I understand the process.

The idea of separating the graphical output into different canvases is to speed up rendering for different parts. For this game, we'll have at least four canvases altogether:

1. The waterfall canvas, where our falling blocks will appear and our cartridge will collect them. This will need to update every cycle.
2. The satchel canvas, which will store the factors we've collected, along with our score. This will only need to be updated when a factor is collected.
3. The effects canvas, which will overlay atop both canvases and will hold special animations for collecting factors, and maybe some tooltips.
4. The metagame canvas, which will store the pause screen, game over screen, and the introduction screens.

## Actions

How wide should we make our waterfall canvas? Let's create some estimates. The waterfall itself can be represented as a margin of about 25 px on either side. Each tile should be in a roughly 5:4 ratio. Let's go for 50 px high and 34 px wide, with a 6 px margin, so that each box is centered within this grid. Our cartridge will be 3 tiles wide. To give enough space to move around, we'll set it to 10 tiles wide. Let's go with 10 tiles high as well; we can adjust these later. Finally, we'll give a 60 px bottom margin, and a 150 px top margin.

That makes the width 25 + (10 * 40) + 25 = 450 px, and the height 150 + (50 * 10) + 60 = 710 px.

The satchel should be as tall as the waterfall, and enough space for two 3-digit primes to appear along with a counter each; let's use a width of 250 px.

Using the Mozilla docs on the canvas element, I add in some basic drawing commands to add two colored rectangles to the waterfall canvas (one for the sky, the other for the water), and one full background to the satchel (a rich leathery color). Then I test locally before committing.

No change. I add a console command and try again to verify that the functions are being called from within the graphics file. I find an error: the waterfallCanvas object is null. Perhaps that is because I loaded the scripts in the header before the body elements were defined. I move the script tags into the body and try again.

Success! Let's go ahead and add in two grassy barriers to the side to make it look more like a waterfall, and also define our margins.
