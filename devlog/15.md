# Day 15: Uncommon Primes Continued

## State of the Game

I paused development of this game in order to focus on other personal projects and programming tools. The game is in basically the same state as it was in October.

## Today's Goal

Show all of the factors of the number, and add the uncommon factors.

## Background

It may not be good practice to pause development of a game when its core functions haven't been fully implemented, but this is a good opportunity to see how readable the code is to someone new to the project. How easy is it for someone who's been away from the code to add a new feature, like showing and hiding a list of all the factors?

## Actions

The first thing I'll do is put the JavaScript files into their own folders. I divide them up into three broad categories: graphics, engine, and math. I subdivide graphics to handle the boxes and the screens. Then I move the `Factor` and `Digit` classes in `box.js` into their own files. All of these changes are then reflected in the HTML files.
