# Day 15: Code Restructuring

## State of the Game

I paused development of this game in order to focus on other personal projects and programming tools. The game is in basically the same state as it was in October.

## Today's Goal

Get back to working with JavaScript and this project in particular to make it easier to use as a developer.

## Background

It may not be good practice to pause development of a game when its core functions haven't been fully implemented, but this is a good opportunity to see how readable the code is to someone new to the project. How easy is it for someone who's been away from the code to add a new feature, like showing and hiding a list of all the factors?

## Actions

The first thing I'll do is put the JavaScript files into their own folders. I divide them up into three broad categories: graphics, engine, and math. I subdivide graphics to handle the boxes and the screens. Then I move the `Factor` and `Digit` classes in `box.js` into their own files. All of these changes are then reflected in the HTML files.

Now I look through the JavaScript files and try to determine if everything each file fulfills a common purpose. Anything that doesn't directly relate to one central purpose gets moved to its own file. Thus, the `setDigitValue` function gets moved from `gameEngine.js` to `digitSelect.js`. It could have been moved to the `waterfallModel.js`, or become part of a new file I've set up `story.js` to eventually handle tutorial interactions, but when in doubt, it's better to keep it separate.

## State of the Game, and Future Plans

With the code given a bit of clean up, I can get back to fixing up the factor display tomorrow.
