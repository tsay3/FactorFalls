# Day 0: Folder Structure

## State of the Game
None! The game doesn't exist, and neither does the repository.

## Today's Goal
Create a project folder and repository for the game to begin constant updates.

## Background
Before production, a designer should always spend a day or two creating a plan for their project, such as deciding what their project actually is and what it is meant to accomplish. This project has a straightforward primary objective: be a project that can be worked on consistently for several days, months if necessary, continuously developing it and improving upon it over time. Of course, most functioning projects already achieve that, so there is an important secondary objective: be an application that is easy to use and understand, while being complex enough to require more than a weekend to program, but not too complex as to require a team or outside resources.

A web game is suitable for this purpose. One could adapt any number of video games, board games or card games, but remaking a familiar game avoids the challenges of designing gameplay and interfaces, not to mention the risks of copying an existing tutorial. Because I DO want to demonstrate a level of creativity and originality, I will be making an original game, although inspired by other puzzle games, especially falling block games.

## Actions

A game is shaped by its requirements. This game should be lightweight and ready to play from any browser, PC or mobile. Mouse gestures should be sufficient to play it (though optional keyboard events may be used).

After considering the possible hardware setups, I have decided to use HTML, JavaScript, and Canvas to code the game. If it fails to work, I will try alternative methods.

I have created a long list of tasks for the game, breaking down every piece of functionality. In an ideal Agile environment, each item on this list would receive an estimated "point value" determining how long it will take to create, and each would be sorted by what other items they would require.

For now, this list will remain in meatspace. Not only would I spoil the surprises for would-be developers, but it would take up too much time to type out, and is unnecessary at this stage.

In a team environment, each team member would be assigned an item to work on, corresponding to their speciality and department. The list includes items that deal with the model (the back-end), the view (the UI/graphics), the controller (the front-end), and the logic layer (the technical calculations). Since I will be making this project alone, I will not be assigning them to different parts, but I will leave myself the option to switch between tasks should I hit a particular roadblock.

How should the project be structured? I will want a src folder to hold my code, and I am currently writing my log in a devlog folder -- I might create a log folder later for bug reports. Looking at my list of tasks, I will eventually add in images and sound effects, so I'll create an assets folder with img and sfx. Because the code is being written in JavaScript and won't need compiling, no bin folder will be added. I don't know yet if I'll need libraries, so I won't add a lib folder.

Let's create a basic webpage that embeds some empty scripts, and adds a header that acts as a "Hello World".
