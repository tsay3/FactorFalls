# Day 13: Code Clean-up II

## State of the Game

When we collect numbers, we see the factors increase, but there isn't a clear feeling of progression. In addition, there's some odd inconsistencies with the numbers upon collecting a number.

## Today's Goal

Do some code cleanup, and hopefully find the source of the drawing issue.

## Background

The code is becoming unwieldy yet again, with multiple functions and variables spread out across multiple files. It's getting hard to test and isolate individual functions when they are dependent on global variables in other files. In addition, some of the names are confusing and difficult to navigate -- what part of our game goes in `game.js`? And what part of the graphics goes in `gameGraphics.js`? This is a good time to do some refactoring of the code.

## Actions

First, let's split up `game.js` to cover the two different halves of the game. As we recall, there are two halves: one covers the waterfall and the collecting of digits into numbers; the other covers the factoring of those numbers, collecting sets of factors, and keeping score. There is also a third unimplemented component that receives input from both of them: a "lives" system, triggered when a digit is missed or a factor is lost.

I create a new file called `waterfallModel.js`, so that this file will store all the variables involved with the waterfall, the digits, and the cartridge. Consider it a black box. At some point we'll throw out numbers that have been collected to the satchel; at some point the satchel model will give back prime factors to highlight. There's no need to store the `lastNumberBuilt`, then; once it's been factored, it's gone.

Let's also reorder the functions so that each component sticks together, and follows the logical progression of the code. We want to start with the tiles being formed, then falling; then the cartridge movement; the collision of tiles with the cartridge; and finally the elimination of cartridge rows.

Most of the `game.js` code ends up in `waterfallModel.js`, with the exception of the `update()` function. This is more a function of the game engine and environment, not the model. The model itself should update with a function call.

`gameGraphics.js` is also split up into `waterfallGraphics.js` and `satchelGraphics.js`.

Finally, I decide to move the `drawDigit` function into its own method within the `Box` class.

## Issues

A few other things had to be cleaned up as well. The main game needed to have the new files added, and the two test files needed to be updated, particularly since the draw functions required the `TILE_WIDTH` variable defined, and the `constants.js` file that defines it needs a `gameCanvas` element defined. In the end, I resort to adding the variable definitions in a custom script inside the test header.

Another issue is that now the number that has been built is no longer drawn. Trying to fix this, but it only prints the default box format, one tile wide, no matter what. It appears a deeper dive into the logic is required.

## State of the Game, and Future Plans

No noticeable updates to the game, but hopefully this should provide the groundwork for the next major step: adding the uncommon prime factors.
